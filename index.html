					The American University of Beirut, one of the most prestigious universities not only in the region but in the world. It was founded in 1866 By Daniel Bliss in Beirut, Lebanon. The computer science department at AUB helped me on fostering my potential and building my skills in order to be successful in the field. Upon graduation, I will be equipped with a myriad of skills because I was able to be exposed to high-quality courses taught by professional people who have worked in the industry for several years, to work collaboratively on projects to further enhance my experience, and to extend my network and meet people with whom I always acquire limitless knowledge. Plus, I am involved in different extra-curricular activities and workshops that made me be more socially conscious to tackle several problems within the society.

					The University of Pennsylvania, also known UPenn, is an Ivy League school located in Philadelphia. Spending a semester abroad at one of the most prestigious universities offers a multi-dimensional experience. At UPenn, I had the chance to take courses with people with different perspectives which enriched my thoughts. I also had the chance to work on a project in the Software Engineering. This project is a real life application of what I learn in class, we work as a group to deliver a software product for our client within the agile software development framework. But what's unique about spending my semester abroad in "Philly" is the opportunity to be socially active by meeting new people, attending various daily events, and especially introducing my culture.

							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have worked on this project with Iskander Gaba as a group project for the web development and design course at the American University of Beirut. Traffic Incidents is a service that allows the user to fetch any incident nearby in an easy, simple and user-friendly manner.<br><br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To use the website, you are invited to create an account in order to start interacting with the website that gives regularly updated and reliable information.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project involves the effective usage of the multiple programming languages and platforms such as JavaScript, PHP, and Jquery that interact with a database. The project additionally required extra knowledge which is beyond the scope of the course. This shows our interest in developing a fully functional website regardless of the limitations.<br><br> <a href="https://traffic-incidents.000webhostapp.com/main.php"  target="_blank">Traffic Incident website</a>
